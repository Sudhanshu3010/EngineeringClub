                                I have over ten years experience as a professional studio guitarist, with adept knowledge in theory and practical skills. I have years of teaching and playing experience both on stage and in the studio.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I can help you reach your goals, from beginner to intermediate at any age!
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I specialize in but not limited to:
                                <br />
                                Rock
                                <br />
                                Jazz
                                <br />
                                Neo-soul/Rnb
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                From basic to advanced music theory and scales, all of which will be incorporated into your lessons based on your level.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I also specialize in more advanced techniques such as sweep picking, legato, thumping, and alternate picking for any intermediates out there!
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I work by doing 1 lesson a week over a 4-week period. If you are enjoying the lessons, feel free to continue until you are at a level you are happy with.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Note: My goal is to get you to a level where you can start making your own riffs/songs and not be reliant on me or any other teacher for you to enjoy your instrument!

                        <p>WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that is most commonly used to build websites, blogs, and eCommerce/online stores. WordPress.com is a hosted platform of websites and blogs owned and managed by Automattic, Inc., where millions of users can create and publish blogs and websites without needing to write a single line of code.</p>

                        <p className='fw-700'>What is WordPress cms?</p>
                        <p>WordPress CMS (content management system) is a system that lets a user organize, manage, and publish content on the web, using the powerful, open-source WordPress software. The WordPress CMS is typically used with themes (templates) to facilitate layout design, and plugins to add extra, custom functionality to the platform.</p>
                   
                        <p className='fw-700'>Can WordPress be used for eCommerce?</p>
                        <p>WordPress can definitely be used to build an eCommerce online store. Because the WordPress CMS software is flexible and powerful, users can create a professional, attractive website and add eCommerce functionality by installing an eCommerce plugin like WooCommerce, the most popular eCommerce plugin for WordPress. You can also upgrade to the eCommerce plan on your account at WordPress.com, which automatically includes the WooCommerce plugin and a collection of the most popular WooCommerce extensions.</p>

                        <p className='fw-700'>Is WordPress free?</p>
